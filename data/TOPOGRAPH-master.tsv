Higher expression level was correlated with resistance and fusion partners containing a dimerization domain promoted paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway and hyperproliferation. AlphaC-IN/DFG-OUT RAF inhibitors blunted paradoxical activation and had increased therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo when combined with MEK inhibitors.	31618628

Median PFS from randomisation was significantly longer in patients switching to Fulvestrant + Palbociclib from Aromatase Inhibitor + Palbociclib (11.9 vs 5.7 months) in patients after detection of rising ESR1 resistance mutation in the circulating tumour DNA assay.	36183733
R2	ESR1	Protein expression	Breast cancer	Entinostat + Exemestane	Phase 3 E2112 trial. NCT02115282. N=608. Entinostat did not improve PFS over placebo (3.3 versus 3.1 months) or OS (23.4 vs 21.7 months) in combination with exemestane. ORR was 6% (Placebo 6%). 35% in the received CDK4/6 prior inhibitor, and 31% received fulvestrant. The Phase 3 data thus contrasts earlier Phase 2 data where a significance improvement of PFS was observed (median PFS 4.3 months versus 2.3 months). 	34357781, 23650416

R2	FAT1	Loss-of-function mutations	Solid tumours	Palbociclib; Ribociclib; Abemaciclib	Preclinical study. Loss-of-function mutations in FAT1 led to increased CDK6 expression, and suppressing CDK6 restored sensitivity to CDK4/6i. The induction of CDK6 was mediated by the Hippo pathway, with YAP and TAZ transcription factors accumulating on the CDK6 promoter. Alterations in other Hippo pathway components also contributed to CDK4/6i resistance.	30537512

In patients with TP53-mutated gastric and gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma, irinotecan and berzosertib did not meet the primary endpoint of ORR of 6% (1/16). Median PFS 4.0 months. Median overall OS 6.2 months.	10.1200/JCO.2023.41.16_suppl.4044

R2	TSC1	Oncogenic mutations	Urothelial carcinoma	Buparlisib	Phase 2. N=19. Buparlisib had modest activity in patients with metastatic UC whose tumors harbored TSC1 loss of function alterations (6 SD and one PR at 8 weeks on therapy).	32767682
R2	Tumour Mutational Burden	High	High-grade gliomas; Anaplastic astrocytoma; Glioblastoma	Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody; Anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody	A case-control series showed no response to PD-L1 blockade in 11 HGG patients with hypermutant and mismatch repair-deficient HGG. High TMB is associated with few clonal neoantigens and no immunogenic responses in glioma populations.	32322066
